# Social-Network-Analysis

This repositiory will serve as a place of reference and development for the "Implentation of Machine Learning" to Social Network Analysis.

The purpose of this function was initially to increase a companies ability to fulturate between prices based on tweets or social inputs (ranging from weather to positive or negative connotation in reviews) from people situated in the proximity of a companies physical location. And as a direct result increase the rate of conversion marketing*. However, now the goal is to - HOPEFULLY - implement machine learning through the use of an unrestricted algrithom.



During the beginning of my participation in this project I focused on developing a way for users to acquire more data by zooming in on populated clusters. [Similiar to Snapchat Map**] But limited information on how to perform such a task quickly killed that idea... so I have shifted direction. 

*The rate by which a potential customer is converted to a actual customer.
